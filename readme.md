```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**

``` bash

```
4. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:

```

5. **Run the application:**
``` bash 
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`. The main features include:

- **Input your question:**
  - Type your question or prompt into the input box.
  
- **Submit and view the response:**
  - Click the "Ask the question" button to send the prompt to the Gemini LLM.
  - View the response generated by the model.

## Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information like API keys. These variables are stored in a `.env` file, which is loaded by the `python-dotenv` library. Below is a sample `.env` file configuration:
``` bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

```

Make sure to replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual API key.
